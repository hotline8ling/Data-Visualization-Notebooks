# Data-Visualization-Notebooks

Welcome to the **Data-Visualization-Notebooks** repository! This collection showcases the Jupyter Notebook exercises and projects completed during my studies at the **University of Santo Tomas** as part of my journey to earn a **Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science**, specializing in **Data Science**.

## Repository Overview
This repository contains various Jupyter Notebooks that demonstrate:

- **Data Analysis:** Extracting insights from datasets using Python and libraries such as pandas, NumPy, and others.
- **Data Visualization:** Creating meaningful and visually appealing representations of data using tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.
- **Machine Learning (where applicable):** Implementing basic ML models for data prediction or classification tasks.
- **Practical Applications:** Applying concepts to real-world datasets to solve problems and answer research questions.

## Introduction
These notebooks were created as part of coursework, personal learning, and project initiatives during my academic journey. They reflect my growth in data science and programming skills.

## Technologies Used
This repository leverages the following tools and libraries:

- **Python 3.x**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**
- **Plotly**
- Other libraries as needed (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow, etc.)
